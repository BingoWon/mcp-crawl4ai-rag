## Overview
This sample shows how to build an immersive video playback experience for visionOS. It demonstrates the use of RealityKit to present multiple content types, in both windows and immersive spaces. It also presents some key factors to consider as you customize your app experience.
## Choose a playback approach
When it comes to providing immersive video playback on visionOS, there are a few different approaches you can take:
  * [AVKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVKit) provides a superior video playback experience in visionOS. With AVKit, you can present an interface that’s consistent with other apps on the system, as it requires the least effort to adopt. For more information on using AVKit in visionOS, see [Adopting the system player interface in visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVKit/adopting-the-system-player-interface-in-visionos).
  * [RealityKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit) enables immersive video playback with [`VideoPlayerComponent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerComponent). RealityKit manages changes in immersive viewing mode to preserve motion comfort, but it requires a little more effort to customize playback controls for your experience.
If you’re already using RealityKit in your app, [`VideoPlayerComponent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerComponent) may be suitable, particularly if your video content is relatively short. In that case, it may not be necessary to offer controls for skipping, or to transition between full immersion and portal window viewing. For design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines > [Playing video](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/playing-video#visionOS).
## Configure video player to play immersive media
[`VideoPlayerComponent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerComponent) relies on three pairs of properties to play immersive media. For each pair, one property is used for mutation, and another for introspection.
Mutation| Introspection  
---|---  
[`desiredImmersiveViewingMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerComponent/desiredImmersiveViewingMode)| [`immersiveViewingMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerComponent/immersiveViewingMode-swift.property)  
[`desiredSpatialVideoMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerComponent/desiredSpatialVideoMode)| [`spatialVideoMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerComponent/spatialVideoMode-swift.property)  
[`desiredViewingMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerComponent/desiredViewingMode-2cahn)| [`viewingMode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerComponent/viewingMode-6bzre)  
The following code configures a video player to present spatial video within a portal window:
```
var videoPlayerComponent = VideoPlayerComponent(avPlayer: player)
videoPlayerComponent.desiredImmersiveViewingMode = .portal
videoPlayerComponent.desiredSpatialVideoMode = .spatial
videoPlayerComponent.desiredViewingMode = .stereo
entity.components[VideoPlayerComponent.self] = videoPlayerComponent
```
Here, the app uses `desiredImmersiveViewingMode` to render the content as a portal window. It then uses `desiredSpatialVideoMode` to apply head-pose–based treatments, and specifies stereoscopic playback with `desiredViewingMode`.
## Size video for the shared space
When presented in an immersive space, [`VideoPlayerComponent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerComponent) automatically manages projection of the video content. In a window, however, additional considerations are necessary to achieve best results.
Because portal-based presentations prefer a 16:9 aspect ratio, the sample uses [`aspectRatio(_:contentMode:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View/aspectRatio\(_:contentMode:\)):
```
VideoPlayerView(videoModel: selection)
  .aspectRatio(CGSize(width: 16, height: 9), contentMode: .fit)
```
The sample uses the [`Entity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/Entity) that contains the `VideoPlayerComponent` to scale the player to fit within the default scene size. When correctly configured, the spatial video has feathered edges with rounded corners.
The sample uses a [`GeometryReader3D`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/GeometryReader3D) to determine the scene size. It then calls `scaleToFit(_:proxy:content:)` from both the `make` and `update` closures of the root [`RealityView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/RealityView), which ensures that the video properly resizes with the content window.
```
GeometryReader3D { geometry in
  RealityView { content in
    configureContent(content, playbackScene: appModel.playbackScene)
    scaleToFit(videoEntity, proxy: geometry, content: content)
    content.add(rootEntity)
  } update: { content in
    scaleToFit(videoEntity, proxy: geometry, content: content)
  }
```
The `scaleToFit(_:proxy:content:)` scales the [`playerScreenSize`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerComponent/playerScreenSize) to fit the size of the containing scene.
```
func scaleToFit(_ entity: Entity, proxy: GeometryProxy3D, content: RealityViewContent) {
  guard let videoPlayer = videoEntity.videoPlayerComponent, videoPlayer.needsScaling else {
    return
  }
  let frame = proxy.frame(in: .local)
  let frameSize = abs(content.convert(frame.size, from: .local, to: .scene))
  entity.scaleToFit(videoPlayer.playerScreenSize, within: frameSize)
}
```
## Customize playback controls
The sample provides custom playback controls with three basic functions:
  1. A toggle for controlling Play and Pause.
  2. Immersion toggle.
  3. Exit, when in an immersive space.
The app uses the same view, `TransportView`, regardless of whether playback occurs in a window or an immersive space.
For playback in the _Shared Space_ , [ornaments](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ornaments) are ideal: they attach to windows without obscuring the content within. For more information, see [Present common controls in an ornament](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/present-common-controls-in-an-ornament).
```
.ornament(attachmentAnchor: .scene(.bottom)) {
  TransportView()
}
```
The _Full Space_ presentation uses the same `TransportView`, but it’s incorporated through composition instead. It is added to an outer type, `ImmersiveControlsView`, which is then placed within a [`ViewAttachmentComponent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/ViewAttachmentComponent) for use in a [`RealityView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/RealityView):
```
private func updateImmersiveControls(with mitigation: VideoPlayerComponent.VideoComfortMitigation? = nil) {
  let controlsAttachment = ViewAttachmentComponent(rootView: ImmersiveControlsView(comfortMitigation: mitigation))
  immersiveControls.components.set(controlsAttachment)
}
```
## Manage changes in immersive viewing mode
For details regarding the immersion toggle, see [`VideoPlayerComponent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerComponent).
## Preserve motion comfort
Because scenes with high motion can lead to motion discomfort, be mindful of motion comfort when presenting media immersively. Two key considerations include: configuring the immersive space properly, and responding to video comfort mitigation events in a timely fashion.
When presenting your content in an [`ImmersiveSpace`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ImmersiveSpace), use a progressive [`ImmersionStyle`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/ImmersionStyle) so that a person can turn the Digital Crown to adjust the amount of visible passthrough video:
```
PlayerImmersiveSpace(sceneIdentifier: Self.sceneID)
  .immersionStyle(
    selection: .constant(ProgressiveImmersionStyle(immersion: 0.01...1, initialAmount: 1)),
    in: .progressive
  )
```
The [`VideoPlayerEvents.VideoComfortMitigationDidOccur`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerEvents/VideoComfortMitigationDidOccur) event includes a single property, [`comfortMitigation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/VideoPlayerEvents/VideoComfortMitigationDidOccur/comfortMitigation). This event indicates that the system detected high motion and took steps to preserve motion comfort based on the person’s preference. The following shows how the sample app subscribes to this event:
```
let comfortMitigations = content.subscribe(
  to: VideoPlayerEvents.VideoComfortMitigationDidOccur.self,
  on: entity
) { event in
  areTransportControlsVisible = true
  updateImmersiveControls(with: event.comfortMitigation)
}
```
The sample uses this event to advise the person that system mitigation took place, and updates `ImmersiveControlsView` accordingly.
