# Accounts
Help users access and manage their external accounts from within your app, without requiring them to enter login credentials.
iOS 5.0+iPadOS 5.0+Mac Catalyst 13.0+macOS 10.8+
Deprecated
The Accounts framework is deprecated. For new apps, instead of using Accounts, contact the provider of the service you integrate with, to get access to their SDK or documentation about managing accounts with their service.
## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Accounts/#overview)
The Accounts framework provides access to user accounts stored in the Accounts database, which is managed by the system. An account stores the login credentials of a particular service, such as LinkedIn, and you use those credentials to authenticate with the service. When you integrate the Accounts framework into your app, you don’t need to store account logins yourself. Instead, the user grants your app access to use their account login credentials, bypassing the need to type their username and password. If no account for a particular service exists in the user’s Accounts database, you can let them create and save an account from within your app.
